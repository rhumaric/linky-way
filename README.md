Linky Way
===

Journey through the Linky Way, a galaxy of concepts and links/notes attached to them.

TODO
---

- [x] Implement in memory storage for the graph of concepts and entries
- [x] Load entries from a CSV file
- [ ] Public front-end (possibly SSG)
  - [ ] concepts as a list
  - [ ] individual concept pages
  - [ ] entries as list
  - [ ] individual entries (sluggify title for better URL)
  - [ ] concepts as a graph (ideally pre-compute positions on server)
- [ ] Extra markdown for entries and lists, using folder structure
- [ ] Admin side for easily updating:
  - entries (URL, title, notes and attached concepts)
  - concepts (notes, human-readable title, graph position)
- [ ] Public/private split of entries and/or links
- [ ] Make it all look pretty ;)
- [ ] Release
